I'm Alex Beal, a Colorado native and Boulder software developer. I have interests in cryptography, decentralization, and programming languages. I'm excited about the idea of engineering society through software with tools like Tor and Bitcoin, and I'm co-organizer of the [Boulder Meshnet](www.bouldermesh.net) initiative. I'm also interested in software reliability, and have a strong interest in better tools and techniques for writing software, such as functional programming (this site is generated with [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)), static analysis, and types. My degrees are in CS and Philosophy from the University of Colorado at Boulder, and I did my [undergraduate thesis](http://media.usrsb.in/files/thesis.pdf) on the dynamic analysis of JavaScript.

###Interests###

- Programming languages ([compilers](A-Program-Analysis-For-Tail-Call-Optimization.html), functional languages, and [theory](Building-Data-Structures-from-Functions.html))
- Security ([cryptography](A-Zero-Knowledge-File-Exchange.html))
- [Math](Super-Bowl-Probabilities--The-Coin-Toss.html)
- Philosophy
- Psychology
- Lots of other things (even the [simplest problems](Picking-Random-Items-From-a-File.html) can be fascinating)
