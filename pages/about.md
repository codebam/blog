I'm Alex Beal, a Colorado native and Boulder software developer. I have interests in cryptography, decentralization, and programming languages. I'm also interested in software reliability, and have a strong interest in better tools and techniques for writing software, such as functional programming (this site is generated with [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)), static analysis, and types. My degrees are in CS and Philosophy from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
